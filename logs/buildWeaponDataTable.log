Carried by aircraft and some ASW missiles. Will not lock on surface targets. In order to achieve the requested range, speed and detection range, a large diameter torpedo was required. This makes the AT-2 one of the few air-launched heavy-weight torpedoes developed during the Cold War. The majority of the air-launched torpedoes are much smaller and only a quarter of the weight. These features preclude the operability of this torpedo from anti-submarine helicopters.<br/>While there is a number of modifications of AT-2 in real world, they are represented by a single version in the game since their differences are irrelevant gamewise.

Earlier submarines of the Echo and Juliet classes used the SS-N-3 Shaddock supersonic cruise missile, whose mid-course guidance required the launching submarine to stay surfaced for long periods. The SS-N-7 instead uses submerged launch, and the relatively short range of the missile means no midcourse guidance is necessary and the submarine can use its own sensors for targeting.

The RIM-67 was developed as a replacement for the RIM-8 Talos, a 1950s system deployed on a variety of USN ships, and eventually replaced the RIM-2 Terrier as well, since it was of a similar size and fitted existing Terrier launchers and magazines. The RIM-66 Standard MR was essentially the same missile without the booster stage, designed to replace the RIM-24 Tartar. The RIM-66/67 series thus became the US Navy's universal SAM system, hence the "Standard Missile" moniker. Guidance system is universal and allows switch between missile, aircraft and ship-attack mode. Mode can be switched in the weapon settings just before launch.

The SM-2MR introduced inertial and command mid-course guidance. The missile's autopilot is programmed to fly the most efficient path to the target and can receive course corrections from the ground. Target illumination for semi-active homing is needed only for a few seconds in the terminal phase of the interception. This capability enables the Aegis combat system and New Threat Upgrade equipped vessels to time share illumination radars, greatly increasing the number of targets that can be engaged in quick succession

Production of this missile ended in 1987; however there are a large number of this model in service and it is expected to remain viable until 2020. The missile features monopulse seeker developed for SM-2, a MK 45 MOD 4 proximity fuze (also known as TDD - Target Detection Device), the MK 115 warhead of SM-2, and MK 45 MOD 6 and MK 45 MOD 7 proximity fuzes.

The missile is specifically designed for the Aegis Combat System and the Mk41 Vertical launch system. The Block IIIB missiles differ from earlier blocks by the addition of the MK 45 MOD 9 target detecting device, for improved performance against low altitude targets, and dual semi-active/infrared seeker for terminal homing. The dual seeker is intended for use in high-ECM environments, against targets over the horizon or with a small radar cross section. The seeker was originally developed for the canceled AIM-7R Sparrow air-to-air missile.

01/23/2022 12:32:29 -  SUCCESS: Got Description Special: Universal<br/>RIM-7 Sea Sparrow is a U.S. ship-borne short-range anti-aircraft and anti-missile weapon system, primarily intended for defense against anti-ship missiles. The system was developed in the early 1960s from the AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile as a lightweight "point-defense" weapon that could be retrofitted to existing ships as quickly as possible, often in place of existing gun-based anti-aircraft weapons. In this incarnation, it was a very simple system guided by a manually aimed radar illuminator. After its introduction, the system underwent significant development into an automated system similar to other US Navy missiles like the RIM-2 Terrier. Contemporary improvements being made to the Sparrow for the air-to-air role led to similar improvements in the Sea Sparrow through the 1970s and 80s. Guidance system is universal and allows switch between missile, aircraft and ship-attack mode. Mode can be switched in the weapon settings just before launch.

This in turn kept them safe from Soviet ASW forces. The missile was then retrofitted into several of the older SSBN classes and Ohio-class submarines. It remained in service until 2005, when it was replaced by the UGM-133 Trident II.
