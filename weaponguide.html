The RIM-67 was developed as a replacement for the RIM-8 Talos, a 1950s system deployed on a variety of USN ships, and eventually replaced the RIM-2 Terrier as well, since it was of a similar size and fitted existing Terrier launchers and magazines. The RIM-66 Standard MR was essentially the same missile without the booster stage, designed to replace the RIM-24 Tartar. The RIM-66/67 series thus became the US Navy's universal SAM system, hence the "Standard Missile" moniker. Guidance system is universal and allows switch between missile, aircraft and ship-attack mode. Mode can be switched in the weapon settings just before launch.</td></tr><tr><td>RIM-66C Standard Missile 2 MR</td><td><img src='https://github.com/DotModGroup/DotModGroup.github.io/raw/main/media/weapons/usn_rim-66cm_sprite.png?raw=true' alt='usn_rim-66cm_sprite.png'></td><td>Special: Surface-to-Air & Anti-Ship Missile<br/>The RIM-66C Standard MR (SM-2MR Block I) was developed in the 1970s and was a key part of the Aegis combat system and New Threat Upgrade (NTU). The SM-2MR introduced inertial and command mid-course guidance. The missile's autopilot is programmed to fly the most efficient path to the target and can receive course corrections from the ground. Target illumination for semi-active homing is needed only for a few seconds in the terminal phase of the interception. This capability enables the Aegis combat system and New Threat Upgrade equipped vessels to time share illumination radars, greatly increasing the number of targets that can be engaged in quick succession</td></tr><tr><td>RIM-66M-5 Standard Missile 2 MR</td><td><img src='https://github.com/DotModGroup/DotModGroup.github.io/raw/main/media/weapons/usn_rim-66cm_sprite.png?raw=true' alt='usn_rim-66cm_sprite.png'></td><td>Special: Surface-to-Air & Anti-Ship Missile<br/>The RIM-66M-5 (SM-2MR Block IIIB) is the version of the Standard missile two medium range (SM-2MR) entered serive in 1998, with the USN aboard Ticonderoga class cruisers, and Arleigh Burke class destroyers. The missile is specifically designed for the Aegis Combat System and the Mk41 Vertical launch system. The Block IIIB missiles differ from earlier blocks by the addition of the MK 45 MOD 9 target detecting device, for improved performance against low altitude targets, and dual semi-active/infrared seeker for terminal homing. The dual seeker is intended for use in high-ECM environments, against targets over the horizon or with a small radar cross section. The seeker was originally developed for the canceled AIM-7R Sparrow air-to-air missile.</td></tr><tr><td>RIM-67A Standard Missile 1 ER</td><td><img src='https://github.com/DotModGroup/DotModGroup.github.io/raw/main/media/weapons/usn_rim-67_sprite.png?raw=true' alt='usn_rim-67_sprite.png'></td><td>Special: Surface-to-Air & Anti-Ship Missile<br/><br/>The RIM-67 Standard ER (SM-1ER/SM-2ER) is an extended range surface-to-air missile (SAM) and anti ship missile originally developed for the United States Navy.

The system was developed in the early 1960s from the AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile as a lightweight "point-defense" weapon that could be retrofitted to existing ships as quickly as possible, often in place of existing gun-based anti-aircraft weapons. In this incarnation, it was a very simple system guided by a manually aimed radar illuminator. After its introduction, the system underwent significant development into an automated system similar to other US Navy missiles like the RIM-2 Terrier. Contemporary improvements being made to the Sparrow for the air-to-air role led to similar improvements in the Sea Sparrow through the 1970s and 80s. Guidance system is universal and allows switch between missile, aircraft and ship-attack mode. Mode can be switched in the weapon settings just before launch.</td></tr><tr><td>RUM-139 VL-ASROC ASW Rocket</td><td><img src='https://github.com/DotModGroup/DotModGroup.github.io/raw/main/media/weapons/usn_rum-139_sprite.png?raw=true' alt='usn_rum-139_sprite.png'></td><td>Surface ship-vertical launched stand-off ASW rocket that flies on an unguided ballistic trajectory and drops a homing Mk-46 lightweight torpedo.

Compared to the Harpoon, it is faster and packs a significantly larger punch. However being larger makes it a bigger target for CIWS.</td></tr><tr><td>Harpoon Missile (UGM-84)</td><td><img src='https://github.com/DotModGroup/DotModGroup.github.io/raw/main/media/weapons/WIP.png?raw=true' alt='WIP.png'></td><td>The Sub-Harpoon has equipped US submarines and their allies since the early 70's. Although a small weapon, with a small warhead and comparatively slow it is very effective against small enemies lacking anti-missile defences. Against better armed targets they probably best launched in salvos to guarantee a hit.</td></tr><tr><td>Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM)</td><td><img src='https://github.com/DotModGroup/DotModGroup.github.io/raw/main/media/weapons/WIP.png?raw=true' alt='WIP.png'></td><td>Land attack version of the UGM-109 Tomahawk missile.

Advanced contour matching and terrain-following radar allows its destructive power to be delivered with pin-point accuracy.</td></tr><tr><td>UGM-96 Trident I</td><td><img src='https://github.com/DotModGroup/DotModGroup.github.io/raw/main/media/weapons/usn_trident_1_sprite.png?raw=true' alt='usn_trident_1_sprite.png'></td><td>The UGM-96 Trident I is a U.S. Navy submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) that first entered service in 1979. It was a major development over the proceeding Poseidan SLBM, as it allowed ballistic missile submarines to launch nuclear strikes from the central Atlantic Ocean. This in turn kept them safe from Soviet ASW forces. The missile was then retrofitted into several of the older SSBN classes and Ohio-class submarines. It remained in service until 2005, when it was replaced by the UGM-133 Trident II.</td></tr><tr><td>Sonobuoys</td><td><img src='https://github.com/DotModGroup/DotModGroup.github.io/raw/main/media/weapons/WIP.png?raw=true' alt='WIP.png'></td><td>Soviet aerial dropped sonobuoys equipped with either passive or active sonar.<br/><br/> Helicopter ASW sonobuoys: <br/>RGB-56 RGB-N Iva 'Crow Egg' active (45kg, 2m) (1956-) <br/>RGB-64 RGB-NM Cinar 'Rook Egg' passive (13.5kg, 1m) (range 1-5 km) (1964-) <br/>RGB-73 RGB-NM-1 Zeton passive (range 3-8 km) (1973-). <br/><br/>Fixed wing ASW sonobuoys: <br/>BM-1 RGB-1 'Snipe Egg 1' non-directional passive <br/>BM-2 RGB-2 'Snipe Egg 2' directional passive <br/>BM-3 RGB-3 'Snipe Egg 3' directional active-only</td></tr>                    </tbody>
