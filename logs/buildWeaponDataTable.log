The Mark 8** was the British torpedo most used during World War II and was supplied to destroyers and MTBs as well as submarines. This torpedo was still in front-line use as late as 1982 during the Falklands War when the submarine HMS Conqueror fired three Mod 4 torpedoes at the Argentine cruiser General Belgrano.

Earlier submarines of the Echo and Juliet classes used the SS-N-3 Shaddock supersonic cruise missile, whose mid-course guidance required the launching submarine to stay surfaced for long periods. The SS-N-7 instead uses submerged launch, and the relatively short range of the missile means no midcourse guidance is necessary and the submarine can use its own sensors for targeting.

01/08/2022 01:23:33 -  SUCCESS: Got Description URPK-3 "Metel'" (NATO classification: SS-N-14 Silex) is a subsonic ASW missile equipped on most Soviet large anti-submarine ships as well as the frigates of the Krivak class. It can be launched to the first convergence zone, and drops an AT-2 homing torpedo. Because it has a larger range than the effective range of the surface ship sonar, it can use targeting data transmitted from any friendly sea or air unit via datalink.

It replaced the R-11FM and R-13 (SS-N-4) on many Golf and Hotel-class submarines, and was in turn superseded by the R-27 (SS-N-6 'Serb') missile carried by Yankee-class submarines.

Thus, extraordinary care must be taken when setting up an attack with these weapons. This slow speed makes them equally ineffective against surface ships, and poor PK against anything other than slow conventional submarines.

01/08/2022 01:23:33 -  SUCCESS: Got Description The Sub-Harpoon has equipped US submarines and their allies since the early 70's. Although a small weapon, with a small warhead and comparatively slow it is very effective against small enemies lacking anti-missile defences. Against better armed targets they probably best launched in salvos to guarantee a hit.

01/08/2022 01:23:33 -  SUCCESS: Got Description The UGM-96 Trident I is a U.S. Navy submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) that first entered service in 1979. It was a major development over the proceeding Poseidan SLBM, as it allowed ballistic missile submarines to launch nuclear strikes from the central Atlantic Ocean. This in turn kept them safe from Soviet ASW forces. The missile was then retrofitted into several of the older SSBN classes and Ohio-class submarines. It remained in service until 2005, when it was replaced by the UGM-133 Trident II.
